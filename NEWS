# 2010.08.05 - 0.2.0
## New features
- When a second notification arrives from the same application, using the same
  title, append it to the existing notification.
- Notifications use blurred background on KDE 4.5.

  tooltips do since KDE 4.4, as well as the Plasma theme foreground color.
- Implemented support for the replacesId parameter.
- It is now possible to specify the screen where the notifications will appear.
- A "Preview" button has been added to the KCM.

## Fixes
- KCM is now translatable.
- The KCM has moved (again!) to the notification group.
- Use an autostart file to start Colibri instead of relying on the DBus service
  system. This solves file conflict problems with other notification systems and
  ensures Colibri is started when the first KDE notification is sent.
- Fixed linking with gold.
