# 2010.07.22 - 0.2.0
## New features
- When a second notification arrives from the same application, using the same
  title, append it to the existing notification.
- Notifications use blurred background on KDE 4.5.
- Notifications use a background halo behind text, similar to what Plasma
  tooltips do since KDE 4.4, as well as the Plasma theme foreground color.
- Implemented support for the replacesId parameter.
- It is now possible to specify the screen where the notifications will appear.
- A "Preview" button has been added to the KCM.
- It is now possible to start Colibri from within the KCM.
- Turkish translation for desktop file by Ozan Çağlayan.
- German translation for desktop file by Michael Gangolf.
- Serbian translation for desktop file by Mladen Pejaković.

## Fixes
- KCM is now translatable.
- The KCM has moved (again!) to the notification group.
- Use an autostart file to start Colibri instead of relying on the DBus service
  system. This solves file conflict problems with other notification systems and
  ensures Colibri is started when the first KDE notification is sent.
- Fixed linking with gold.

# 2010.02.16 - 0.1.1
- Moved the KCM to the Desktop category.
- Emit the NotificationClosed() signal when a notification is closed. This fixes
  double notifications from Banshee.
- Implement the CloseNotification() method.

# 2009.12.15 - 0.1.0
- First release.
