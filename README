# What is it?

Colibri provides an alternative to KDE4 Plasma notifications.

Colibri notifications look lighter and are completely passive: they do not
provide any buttons. You may or may not like this.

Since they are completely passive, they smoothly fade away when you mouse over
them, allowing you to interact with any window behind them.


# Building it

You need kdelibs >= 4.3.

Build it with:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr <path/to/colibri/sources>
    make
    sudo make install

You may need to replace /usr with the path to your KDE installation.

# Enabling Colibri notifications

Enabling Colibri notifications can be a bit tricky:


## First, disable Plasma notifications

- Right-click on the systemtray applet
- Select "System Tray Settings"
- Uncheck the "Application notifications" box


## Second, check the .service file

Make sure the .service file is correctly installed. On most systems you
should be able to find it here:

/usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service

This file should contains an "Exec" line pointing to Colibri binary.


## Third, test it

Run this:

    kdialog --passivepopup Hello

You should get a nice Colibri notification in the top-right corner.


# Configuration

The only configuration for now is the position of the notification. This can be
configured from "System Settings": Colibri installs a configuration module in
the "Appearance" category.


# A bit of politics

Colibri is a standalone implementation of Ayatana notifications for Plasma, an
alternative notification system which I implemented in Kubuntu Karmic as part
of my work for Canonical.

Ayatana notifications were implemented as a patch against the systemtray
applet. Colibri notifications do not require patching any applet.

Colibri contains code I wrote for Canonical, but it is not a Canonical product.
