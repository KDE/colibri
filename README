# What is it?

Colibri provides an alternative to KDE4 Plasma notifications.

Colibri notifications look lighter and are completely passive: they do not
provide any buttons. You may or may not like this.

Since they are completely passive, they smoothly fade away when you mouse over
them, allowing you to interact with any window behind them.

They also do not stack each others: if multiple notifications happen, they will
be shown one at a time.

Colibri is licensed under the GNU GPLv2 or later.

# Building it

You need kdelibs >= 4.4.

Build it with:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr <path/to/colibri/sources>
    make
    sudo make install

You may need to replace /usr with the path to your KDE installation.

# Enabling Colibri notifications

Enabling Colibri notifications can be a bit tricky.

First you need to open Colibri module in "System Settings":
- Start "System Settings"
- Open the "System and Application Notifications" category
- Select "Colibri Notifications"

## Another notification system is running

If there is an error bar telling you to stop an existing notification system,
here is how to do it, depending on the current notification system.

If the system is "notify-osd" or "notification-daemon", just stop them with
"killall notify-osd" or "killall notification-daemon".

If the system is "Plasma", you must disable notification handling in Plasma.

To do so on KDE 4.4:
- Right-click on the systemtray applet
- Select "System Tray Settings"
- Uncheck the "Application notifications" box

To do so on KDE 4.5:
- Right-click on the (i) icon in the systemtray applet
- Select "Notification Settings"
- Unckeck the "Application notifications" box

## No notification system is running

Just click the "Start Colibri" button.

## Testing it

Click the "Preview" button, you should see a notification appear in the
selected corner.

# A bit of history

Passive notifications for Plasma first appeared as "Ayatana notifications", an
alternative notification system I implemented in Kubuntu Karmic as part of my
work for Canonical.

Ayatana notifications were implemented as a patch against the systemtray
applet. Colibri is based on this work, but does not require patching any
applet.

Colibri contains code I wrote for Canonical, but it is not a Canonical product.
